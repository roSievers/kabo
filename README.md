# Kabo
This project aims to implement the game mechanics for the card game [Cabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_(game)).
It should also implement some interfaces for players and interfaces to talk to it. I don't expect Kabo to contain
a GUI for playing Cabo, only a server. That could be a separate Project.

## Compiling

Get stable rust from [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/), install cargo and use `cargo run` to run the project.
